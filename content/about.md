## about me

my name's sam[^1], and i use any pronouns. my hobbies include music (which i'm
currently studying)  -- both listening to and making -- as well as programming,
and the occasional spot of cooking. i can play the piano, the drums, and i'm
teaching myself the guitar, plus i'm competent at operating DAWs such as Logic
Pro and Studio One. coding-wise, i prefer functional languages such as
[Haskell](/tags/haskell/) and [Clojure](/tags/clojure/), as well as those which
have taken inspiration from the functional paradigm such as
[Rust](/tags/rust/).

## about this site

this site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), using my own custom
templates. i've built it to make maximum use of semantic HTML elements, with
`<div>`s and the like used only sparingly. i've also tried to minimize the
amount of JavaScript at play; in fact, the only scripting on this entire
website is to persist the user's chosen theme between page reloads. you can
[view the source code](https://github.com/djscythe/samskeo.ch) for the
entire website on my GitHub.

[^1]: i usually spell it in all lower-case, but i'm not too picky in that
    regard.
